# Pyber_analysis
## Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis was to produce a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type, a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type, and report documenting the results. 

## Results: 
Total rides varied by city type. Rural cities had 125 total rides, whereas suburban and Urban cities had 625 and 1625 total rides, respectively. Total drivers also varied similarly, with urban cities having the most drivers (2405); suburban and rural cities had 78 and 490 total drivers respectively. Urban cities had the highest amount of fares gathered ($39854.38), trailed by suburban cities ($19356.33) and rural cities ($4327.93). Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride, averaging $34.6 per ride. Suburban cities had an average of $30.97 fare per ride and urban cities had $24.5 average fare per ride. Similarly, Rural cities had the highest average fare per driver (R: $55.48, S: $39.5, U: $16.57)

The total fare by city type can be visualized below:

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
To address disparies between city types, it seems as though having a higher volume of drivers and shorter rides (indicated by lower average fares) contributes to higher total fares. ALong that line, promoting driver jobs in suburban and rural cities could increase the volume of rides taken, thus increasing total fares. Another step to take would be to offer ride promotions to encourage rural and suburban populations to use PyBer more often. However, the most comprehensive way to address disparities would be to support urbanization projects in rural and suburban city types so as to increase the dependence on services such as Pyber.
